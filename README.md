# stocks-analysis

## Overview of Project
The goal of this project was to demonstrate how to utilize index values in VBA to simplify and quicken the analysis process that takes place in the Stocks Analysis. This will enable future in-depth research using this data source, which may be more successful with potentially bigger data sets.

### Improved Speed Upon Refactoring

The results have been changed to give the same outcomes while looping through the rows only once in the process of refactoring. This has significantly speeded up the execution time of the code while maintaining similar outcomes. The refactored code is also applicable to more data because none of the columns or rows are hard-coded, as long as they exist in any given spreadsheet.

### 2017 Stock Results

### 2018 Stock Results

The tables above demonstrate that the investments performed considerably worse in 2018 than they had in 2017. RUN, on the other hand, had a significantly higher return percentage and was the only stock to rise between the two years.

## Summary
### Advantages of Refactoring
- Improve readability
- Improve performance or decrease memory usage

### Disadvantages of Refactoring
- The process can be quite time consuming if working with unfamiliar code
- There is a chance of breaking or ceasing the functionality of the code if you are unfamiliar with the code

### Pros and Cons Applied to Challenge
The greatest advantage of refactoring for this task is improved performance. In this situation, allowing the code to run faster has a minor impact, but if it's done on a larger data set or with more outputs, the enhanced efficiency would be beneficial to the analyst. This efficiency was attainable due to the use of indexValues.

In this particular circumstance, we had some understanding of the early phases and processes. However, I could envision a time when strange code would be difficult to debug in the future. This is most likely until more experience is acquired.
